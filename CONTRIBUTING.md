# Source Code Management

We are using git and github as source code management and bug tracker systems. 
Development takes place on the "prototype" or alternatively feature-branches.
So please prepare your pull-requests against "prototype".
Changes will committed to master only during a release. 

# Test Data
We have not yet settled down on an approach how to manage test data. For the
moment, small test examples are committed to the repository, but is  
impractical to have large files in there. Please avoid that. 

If you have any suggestions, ideas or examples on how to manage that, please 
let us now.
