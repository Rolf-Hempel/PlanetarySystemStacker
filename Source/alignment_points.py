        - a phase correlation algorithm (miscellaneous.translation)

          "search_local_match_gradient". This method is faster than the previous one, but it has no
          subpixel option.

        Be careful with the sign of the local shift values. For the first two methods, a positive
        value means that the current frame has to be shifted in the positive coordinate direction
        in order to make objects in the frame match with their counterparts in the reference frame.
        In other words: If the shift is positive, an object in the current frame is at lower pixel
        coordinates as compared to the reference. This is very counter-intuitive, but to make the
        three methods consistent, the same approach was followed in the implementation of the third
        method "search_local_match", contained in this module. There, a pixel box around an
        alignment point in the current frame is moved until the content of the box matches with the
        corresponding box in the reference frame. If at this point the box is shifted towards a
